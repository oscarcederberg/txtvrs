SVT Text TV Terminal Application

scrapes [SVT Text](https://www.svt.se/text-tv)\
inspired by [txtv, by voidcase](https://github.com/voidcase/txtv)

i find the appeal of console applications and swedish text tv to overlap quite a bit, and being able to read the news in the terminal is very comfy. however, the original program no longer works for me. i've wanted to learn rust for a while now, and recreating the functionality of the txtv program seem like a good medium-sized project for that purpose.
